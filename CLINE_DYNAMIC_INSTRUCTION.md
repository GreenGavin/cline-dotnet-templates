# Cline Dynamic Templates

## Auto-Setup Process
At the start of every session:

1. **Detect project type**:
   - .NET projects: Look for `.sln`, `.csproj`, `Program.cs`
   - Cross-platform: Look for `package.json` with React Native/Electron

2. **Download setup instructions**:
   - .NET: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreenGavin/cline-dotnet-templates/main/CLINE_SETUP.md`
   - Cross-platform: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreenGavin/cline-crossplatform-templates/main/CLINE_SETUP.md`

3. **Follow the setup instructions exactly** as written in the downloaded file

4. **After setup completion, read and follow `.cline/instructions.md`** for all development work
   - This is the main project guidance file
   - It will reference other files (git-workflow.md, security-notes.md, github-integration.md) as needed
   - Always check this file at the start of any development task

## Development Guidelines
- **Primary guidance**: Always read `.cline/instructions.md` before starting any task
- **Secondary files**: Follow references to git-workflow.md, security-notes.md, etc. when mentioned in instructions
- **Template usage**: Use downloaded templates for consistent formatting and standards
- **Version management**: Respect user modifications and provide update options when template versions change
